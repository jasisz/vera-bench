# VeraBench

A benchmark for evaluating LLM code generation in [Vera](https://github.com/aallan/vera), a programming language designed for large language models (LLMs) to write.

## Overview

VeraBench measures whether LLMs write better code in a language designed for them. Vera uses typed slot references instead of variable names, mandatory contracts, and explicit algebraic effects — all features that should make LLM-generated code more verifiable.

The benchmark covers five difficulty tiers:

| Tier | Focus | What it tests |
|------|-------|--------------|
| 1 | Pure arithmetic | Basic syntax, `@T.n` slot references, simple contracts |
| 2 | String & array ops | Built-in function discovery (`domain_verb` naming) |
| 3 | ADTs & match | Data type definition, De Bruijn indices in match arms |
| 4 | Recursion & termination | `decreases` clauses, Z3 verification |
| 5 | Multi-function & effects | IO, State, Exn, effect propagation across functions |

For each problem, we measure:

- **check@1** — Does the code pass `vera check` on first attempt?
- **verify@1** — Does it pass `vera verify` (Z3 contract verification)?
- **fix@1** — Given the error message, can the model fix it in one turn?
- **run_correct** — Does execution produce the correct output?

The same problems are also run in Python and TypeScript as baselines.

## Prerequisites

* Python 3.11+
* Git

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/aallan/vera-bench.git
cd vera-bench
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -e ".[llm]"
```

The `[llm]` extra installs the Anthropic and OpenAI SDKs. Use `pip install -e .` if you only need validation (no model evaluation).

### Install the Vera compiler

The `vera` command must be available on `$PATH`. Install it anywhere into the same environment, either from a local clone,

```bash
pip install -e /path/to/vera          
```

or directly from GitHub.

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/aallan/vera.git   
```
Afterwards you should be able to print the Vera version from the terminal,

```bash
vera version   
```

this should return v0.0.104 or later.

## Quick start

Once Vera is installed you can run the benchmark from the terminal,

```bash
# Validate all 50 problems and canonical solutions
vera-bench validate

# Run benchmark against a model
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...
vera-bench run --model claude-sonnet-4-20250514

# Run a single tier
vera-bench run --model claude-sonnet-4-20250514 --tier 1

# Run a single problem
vera-bench run --model claude-sonnet-4-20250514 --problem VB-T1-001

# Spec-from-NL mode (agent writes its own contracts)
vera-bench run --model claude-sonnet-4-20250514 --mode spec-from-nl

# Run Python baselines for comparison
vera-bench baselines

# Generate a report from results
vera-bench report results/
```

## Results

Running `vera-bench report results/` generates `results/summary.md` with a per-model summary:

| Model | check@1 | verify@1 | fix@1 | run_correct | Problems |
|-------|---------|----------|-------|-------------|----------|
| claude-sonnet-4-20250514 | 82% | 74% | 45% | 70% | 50 |

Plus per-tier breakdowns and per-problem detail. Each `vera-bench run` writes incremental JSONL results (one line per problem attempt), so partial runs are resumable and always reportable.

## Prior art

VeraBench is inspired by:

- [HumanEval](https://github.com/openai/human-eval) — 164 Python function completion problems
- [MBPP](https://github.com/google-research/google-research/tree/master/mbpp) — 974 Python problems from natural language
- [DafnyBench](https://github.com/sun-wendy/DafnyBench) — 782 Dafny verification annotation problems

DafnyBench demonstrated that tracking verification success rates over time attracts genuine research attention — success rates went from 68% to 96% across model generations in under two years. VeraBench aims to create the same longitudinal story for a language designed from scratch for LLM code generation.
